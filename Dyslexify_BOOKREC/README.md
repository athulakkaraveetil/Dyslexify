<h3>How we did?</h3>  
✅The daal4py is used here.The main purpose of using daal4py in the project is to leverage the optimized implementations of algorithms provided by oneDAL.<br><br>
✅The oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) and its Python wrapper, daal4py, are used for computing cosine similarity between vectors.<br><br>
